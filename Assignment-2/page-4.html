        <h2> Semantic Element</h2>
        <p> &emsp;&emsp;When building web pages, we use a combination of non-semantic <strong>HTML</strong>
            and semantiv <strong>HTML.</strong> <br> The word semantic means <strong><i>"relating to meaning"
                    </i></strong>
            ,so semantic elements provide information about <br> the content between the opening and closing
            tags.</p>
        <p> &emsp;&emsp;By using semantic <strong>HTML</strong>, we select <Strong>HTML</Strong> elements based on thier
            meaning
            , not on how they are presented. <br> Elements such as <strong><code>&lt;div&gt;</code></strong> and
            <strong><code>&lt;span&gt;</code></strong>
            are not semantic elements
            since they provide no context as to what is inside of those tags.
        </p>
        <p> &emsp;&emsp;For example, instead of using a <strong><code>&lt;div&gt;</code></strong> element to contain our
            header
            infromation, <br> we could use
            a <strong><code>&lt;header&gt;</code></strong> tag instead of a <strong><code>&lt;div&gt;</code></strong>,
            we provide context
            as to what information is inside
            of the opening and closing tag.</p>
        <h2>Why we use Semantic Elements? </h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong>Semantic <Strong>HTML</Strong>make webpages accessible for mobile
                <br>
                devices and for people with disabilities as well. This is beacuse screen <br> readers and
                browsers are able to interpret and code better.
            </li>
            <li><strong>SEO</strong>: It improves the website <strong>Seo</strong>, or Search Engine
                Optimization,which <br>
                is the process of increasing the number of people that visit your webpage. <br>With better
                <strong>SEO</strong> search engine are better able toidentify the content
                of your <br> website and weight the most important content appropriately.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Easy to understand</strong>: Semantic <strong>HTMl</strong> also makes the wensite's
                source code easier to read for other web developers. <br>
            </li>
        </ul>
        </dt>
        </dl>
        <p>To better understand this, you can think of comparing non-semantic <strong>HTML</strong> to going into a
            store with no signs on the aisles. <br> Since the aisles aren't labeled,
            you don't know what products are in those aisles. However, stores that do have signs for each aisle <br>
            make it lot easier to find the items you need, just like Semantic <strong>HTML.</strong> </p>
        <p>Many websites contain <strong>HTML</strong> code like: <code>&lt;div id="header"&gt;</code>,
            <code>&lt;div id="nav" &gt;</code> , <br>
            <code>&lt;div id="main"&gt;</code>,<code> &lt; div id="footer"&gt;</code> to include header, navigation,
            main content and footer.
